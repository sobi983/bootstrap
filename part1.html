            According to some “experts,” losing weight and keeping it off is all
            about controlling the types of food you eat.
          </h3>
          <p class="paras">
            They say particular foods are "fattening" because they pause fat
            burning and cause a hormonal environment that leads to weight
            gain... while other foods "balance"<br />
            the system and stimulate fat loss.
            <br /><br />
            While that’s partially true, it doesn't give you the full picture.
            The reason is that if you want to lower the number on your
           
            scale, the most important thing you must do is enter a caloric
            deficit.<br /><br />
            It’s simple.If you consume more calories than you burn,you’ll gain
            weight.And if you consume fewer calories than you burn,you’ll lose
            weight.That’s a scientific fact.<br /><br />
            <div class="paras" style="width: 92%;">Looking for proof?Well,dozens of studies show the vitality of
              calorie balance.One of these is a case study by Mark Haub,a
              professor of human nutrition at Kansas State University.</div> <br>
              <div class="paras" style="width: 82%;">He carried excess pounds and, knowing the importance of calorie balance, decided to do an
                experiment. For two months, he only ate foods like Twinkies, Oreos, Dorito, and protein shakes
                while maintaining a daily energy deficit of 800 calories.</div> <br>
                <div class="paras" style="width: 90%;">The result? In just two months, he lost 27 pounds and reduced his body fat from 33.4% to 24.9%. </div><br>
                <h3 class="colorOfComponent22">
                  Now, I don't recommend you follow such a diet, but it illustrates my point.
                  If you want to lose fat, you must be in a calorie deficit.

        <p class="colorOfComponent555">
          Wrong! Many people make this mistake, and I used to do it too before I knew any better. <br> <br>
          The truth is, severe calorie deficits screw up your physiology. That's why almost all low-calorie dieters regain the lost pounds when they stop the program... plus, most often gain some more on top of that. <br> <br>
          You see, your body doesn't know you're trying to get ripped for the beach. Instead, because you're starving yourself, it thinks you're stranded with no food. <br><br>
          As a result, your body’s metabolism will plummet to prevent you from losing weight. This means that as soon as you come off your diet, your body will store as much food as possible as fat to prepare itself for the next starvation. <br> <br>
          That’s why it’s essential to eat according to a calorie target fine-tuned for your body, your situation, and your goals.

          Thus far, we've looked at calories. And while calories are a crucial piece of the fat loss puzzle, they're in no way the only thing that matters. You see, when most people say they want to lose weight, they actually strive to improve their health and look better. <br> <br>
          The thing is, if you want to accomplish such feats, you shouldn’t strive for weight loss. Instead, set your sights on fat loss. That's because losing weight doesn't necessarily improve health and appearance, but losing fat does. <br>Now, when it comes to fat loss, calories remain a crucial element. But what is just as crucial is your macro intake. In other words, your consumption of protein, carbs, and fat is vital. How you set up your macros has a profound effect on how your body will respond to the meals you eat. <br>
          For example, if you consume too many carbs, it’ll be near impossible to lose fat even if you maintain a calorie deficit. That’s because carbs spike insulin, a hormone that blunts fat loss in two main ways.One of these is that elevated insulin levels block the release of fat from your fat cells.And if your cells can't release fat, your body can never burn off the excess. 
          <br> <br>

    </div>

    <div class="row">
     
      <h5 class="col-lg-4 col-xl-4 paras pt-5"> Second, elevated insulin levels cause the storage  of energy found in your bloodstream to morph into body fat cells.This means the energy won’t get burned off by tissues like muscle but instead snakes its way around to places like your hips and abs. <br> That’s why researchers call insulin the "fat storage hormone," and that’s why carb-rich diets make it nearly impossible to lose fat.</h5>

  Willpower works like a battery – you only have so much of it until it runs out. That’s why very restrictive diets deplete your willpower, increase your cravings, and lead to binging – the exact opposite of what you want when trying to build your dream body. <br> <br>
  I've seen it countless times before... a guy or gal who is dedicated to losing weight and getting healthy. To kick things off, they start a diet that only allows food like tilapia, asparagus, and chicken. After all, that’s what the fitness magazines recommend. <br> 
  While the results are great in the beginning and the dieter loyally brings Tupperware boxes packed with "healthy" meals wherever they go, their willpower eventually runs out and that diet gets tossed out the window. <br> <br>
  Just keep in mind that dieting itself is already hard. Don't make it even harder for yourself by enforcing all kinds of unnecessary restrictions. Otherwise, you’ll likely take on a “screw it” mentally after a few weeks or even days, wake up in a sea of Twinkie wrappers and be back to square one.

          High blood pressure, or hypertension, can increase the risk for health issues, including heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes, according to the Physicians Com-mittee for Responsible Medicine. <br> <br>
          Luckily, the foods you eat can make a difference. Several studies have shown that sticking with a plant-based diet can reduce blood pressure, therby reducing your risk for those conditions. <br> <br>
          A meta-analysis published in April 2014 in JAMA Internal Medicine explored data from 39 studies and concluded that people who fol-lowed a vegetarian diet had lower blood pressure on average than those who followed omnivorous diets </small>

          Research suggests that the answer could be yes. The American Institute for Cancer Research says the best way to source cancer-protective nutrients, including fiber, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals, is to eat a diet rich in vegetables, fruit, grains, beans, nuts, seeds, and some animal foods and the same goes for cancer survivors.
          <br> <br>
           A review published in 2011 in Cancer Management and Research notes the protective benefits are there, though they’re moderate (lowering the risk for certain cancers by about 10 percent) and are likely due to the nutrients present in plant foods and because eating this way promotes a healthy weight.</small>

        High cholesterol can lead to fatty deposits in the blood, which can restrict blood flow and potentially lead to heart attack, stroke, or heart disease. But a healthy diet can help keep cholesterol levels in check. Specifically, moving away from a diet filled with animal products toward one that’s primarily plant based can lower LDL (“bad”) cholesterol by between 10 and 15 percent, while those following a strict plant based diet can lower their LDL cholesterol by as much as 25 percent, according to a review of 27 studies published in The American Journal of Cardiology.</small>
